## Roteasy
Perform rotations in a 3D space. They can be used for example to operate coordinate transformation between different frame of references.  The module lets the user to defines their rotation angles combining any amount of subsequent rotations but it can also define automatically the rotations needed to align a given axis of the original frame of reference with a given direction provided by the user. 


**WARNING:** roteasy and its documentation are still under development. 
Comments and suggestions are welcome!
If you are interested in using it and/or in introducing new functionalities you can send me an email (giuliano.iorio89@gmail.com).
